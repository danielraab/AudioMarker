   npm run db:push
   ```

5. **Create an admin user**
   ```bash
   npm run admin:create your-email@example.com
   ```

6. **Start the development server**

   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Quick Start Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start development server with Turbopack
npm run db:studio        # Open Prisma Studio to view/edit data
npm run lint             # Run ESLint
npm run typecheck        # Run TypeScript type checking

# Production
npm run build            # Build for production
npm run start            # Start production server

# Database
npm run db:push          # Push schema changes to database
npm run db:generate      # Run Prisma migrations
npm run db:migrate       # Deploy migrations to production
```

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

This project includes Docker support and automated CI/CD pipelines. All Docker-related files are located in the [`docker/`](docker/) directory.

### Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Using docker-compose (recommended)
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Or build and run manually
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t audio-marker .
docker run -p 3000:3000 audio-marker
```

### Automated Docker Builds

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows that automatically build and push Docker images:

- **GitHub Container Registry**: Automatically builds on push to main/develop branches
- **Docker Hub**: Optional workflow for Docker Hub deployment

For detailed setup instructions, see [Docker Documentation](./docker/README.Docker.md).

### Production Deployment

For production deployments, make sure to:
- Use a proper database (PostgreSQL recommended)
- Set appropriate environment variables
- Configure reverse proxy (nginx recommended)
- Enable HTTPS/SSL
- Set up proper backup strategies

### Known Issues

#### File Upload Problem with nginx

Add the following nginx configuration to solve upload issues:

```nginx
client_max_body_size 50M;
proxy_request_buffering off;
proxy_buffering off;
```

## üë§ Admin User Management

Create or promote users to admin status using the CLI command:

```bash
# Development
npm run admin:create <email>

# Production (standalone)
npx tsx scripts/create-admin.ts <email>

# Production (Docker)
docker exec -it <container-name> npm run admin:create <email>
```

Example:
```bash
# Development
npm run admin:create admin@example.com

# Docker
docker exec -it audio-marker npm run admin:create admin@example.com
```

For more details, see [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md).

## üíª Development

# Start development server with hot reload
npm run dev
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Lint code
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix          # Auto-fix linting issues

# Format code
npm run format:check
npm run format:write      # Auto-format code
